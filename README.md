* In deep learning we basically define a computation graph in Python and tensorflow takes the graph perform its computation using optimized C++   code.
* A TensorFlow program is typically split into two parts: the first part builds a computation graph (this is called the construction phase),and   the second part runs it (this is the execution phase).
