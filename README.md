* To run tensorboard
    ``` 
    tensorboard --logdir=data/ --host localhost --port 8088
    ```
* In deep learning we basically define a computation graph in Python and tensorflow takes the graph perform its computation using optimized C++   code.
* A TensorFlow program is typically split into two parts: the first part builds a computation graph (this is called the construction phase),and   the second part runs it (this is the execution phase).
* When there is one layer we call it NEURAL NETWORK.
* When there is multiple layers we call it DEEP NEURAL NETWORK.
